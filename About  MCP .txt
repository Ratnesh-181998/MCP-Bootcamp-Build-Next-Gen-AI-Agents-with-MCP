Master MCP to connect, extend, and automate LLMs — build context-aware, multi-agent AI systems from scratch

Description

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is transforming how modern AI systems operate. It is an emerging standard that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact intelligently with external tools, APIs, and data sources. By learning MCP, you will understand how context flows between AI models and their environments, enabling the creation of truly autonomous and context-aware systems.
This Complete Model Context Protocol (MCP) Bootcamp provides an in-depth understanding of how MCP works and how to implement it effectively in real-world AI applications. You will explore MCP’s architecture, its role in the Agentic AI ecosystem, and its integration with frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI. The course is fully practical, project-based, and designed for professionals building advanced AI workflows.
